# William "Cody" Jennings Data Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! This repository showcases data analysis projects I've completed to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!

About Me:
Hi! I am a data analyst based in Puyallup Washington with a background in mathematics and finance. I'm a big math nerd, and a member / speaker for the Puyallup Mathematic Society where we give community presentations on a wide range of topics. We also do SAT prep and give younger students an opportunity to give presentations of their own. My passion for math led me to the world of data where I get to use my skills to transform data sets into real-world insights and stories.

-- July 2025 -- eSports Tournament Match ELO System (Work In Progress) -- So far I have created an ETL Pipeline in Python to webscrape bracket data from the Start.GG API to load into a PostgreSQL relational database built of my own design.
