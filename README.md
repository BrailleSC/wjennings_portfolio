# William "Cody" Jennings Data Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! This repository showcases data analysis projects I've completed to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!

About Me:
Hi! I am a data analyst based in Puyallup Washington with a background in mathematics and finance. I'm a big math nerd and a member / speaker of the Puyallup Mathematic Society where we give community presentations on a wide range of topics, SAT prep, and give younger students an opportunity to give presentations of their own. My passion for math led me to the world of data where I get to use my skills to transform data sets into real-world insights and stories.

**Project Summary**

-- July 2025 -- Airbnb Revenue Analysis (2016 Data) [(./airbnb_analysis_2016)] -- Used Airbnb calendar and listings data to build a linear regression model predicting yearly revenue based on number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and review scores. Includes cleaned visualizations and discussion. 

-- July 2025 -- eSports Tournament Match ELO System -- I've created an ETL Pipeline in Python to pull tournament bracket data from the Start.GG API and load it into a PostgreSQL relational database. I then used a plpgSQL function to calculate player skill ratings based on the ELO system, and write to a per match, per player ledger and a most recent ratings snapshot table. Besides ranking players, this allows me to pull up a ton of fun queries like longest winstreaks, hardest bracket paths, biggest upsets, etc.

-- *(More coming soon)* | Stay tuned for upcoming work in SQL, Tableau dashboards, and exploratory data projects.

**Tools Used**

- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, broom)
- Excel
- Tableau
- PostgreSQL 
- Python (AI assissted, still learning)
- Git/GitHub
